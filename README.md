# Rocket-Payload-Project
Developed code using Arduino IDE measuring vibrational stability, flex, and vibrational forces using GPS, accelerometer, altimeter, and flex sensors. This was as part of the Student Space Programs Laboratory training program

## Features
- GPS module integration
- Accelerometer (MMA8452Q) interfacing
- Altimeter (Adafruit MPL3115A2) data collection
- Flex sensor implementation
- Vibration sensor data processing
